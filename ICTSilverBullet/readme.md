Based on the transcript provided, here is the complete breakdown of the **ICT Silver Bullet** trading model. This is a time-based algorithmic trading strategy designed to be a high-probability, repeatable setup that forms every single trading day.

### **1. Core Parameters**
*   **Asset Class:** Works on all assets (Indices, Forex, Futures).
*   **Time Zone:** All times must be set to **New York Local Time**.
*   **Chart Frequency:** Every trading day.
*   **Execution:** The setup pattern (Fair Value Gap formation and entry) must occur **within the specific 60-minute window**, though the trade duration may extend past the hour.

### **2. The Three Time Windows (Silver Bullet Hours)**
You are looking for the setup to form specifically during these three 60-minute intervals (New York Time):

1.  **London Open Silver Bullet:** 3:00 AM – 4:00 AM
2.  **AM Session Silver Bullet:** 10:00 AM – 11:00 AM
3.  **PM Session Silver Bullet:** 2:00 PM – 3:00 PM

### **3. Trade Framework (Targets & Movement)**
Before taking a trade, the market must offer a specific "Framework"—meaning there is enough room for price to move before hitting a major resistance or liquidity pool.

**For Indices (e.g., S&P 500, Nasdaq):**
*   **Minimum Framework:** The market structure must allow for a move of at least **10 Points** (40 ticks).
*   **Bread & Butter Target:** 5 Handles (Points).
*   **Ideal Target:** 10 Handles (Points).

**For Forex:**
*   **Minimum Framework:** The market structure must allow for a move of at least **15 Pips**.
*   **Bread & Butter Target:** 10 Pips.
*   **Ideal Target:** 20 Pips.

*Note: The "Framework" is the best-case delivery price is offering. You do not need to catch the entire move, but the potential for that move must exist for the trade to be high probability.*

### **4. The Setup Logic (Context)**
The strategy relies on determining the **Draw on Liquidity** (Where is price likely to go next?). You are looking for price to move toward one of these objectives:

*   **Previous Daily High or Low:** A run on yesterday's liquidity.
*   **Previous Session High or Low:** e.g., NY AM session running London stops.
*   **Previous Weekly High or Low.**
*   **Return to New Week Opening Gap (NWOG):** Either current or old gaps.
*   **Expansion away from NWOG.**
*   **Classic Liquidity Pools:** Buy Stops (above old highs) or Sell Stops (below old lows).

---

### **5. Execution & Entry Model**
Once you have determined the direction (Bias) and the Draw on Liquidity, follow these steps within the 60-minute window:

1.  **Wait for Liquidity Sweep:** Look for price to take out a short-term high (if bearish) or short-term low (if bullish) OR trade into a higher timeframe PD Array (like a 15m Fair Value Gap).
2.  **Market Structure Shift (MSS):** Look for an energetic move in your intended direction that breaks market structure (displacement).
3.  **Fair Value Gap (FVG):** The displacement must leave behind a Fair Value Gap (an inefficiency).
4.  **The Entry:** Place a limit order to enter inside that Fair Value Gap.
    *   *Filter:* The bodies of the candles should respect the FVG (stay inside it). Wicks can do damage, but bodies tell the story.
5.  **Stop Loss:** typically placed at the swing high/low that created the displacement.
6.  **Take Profit:** Aim for the opposing liquidity pool, or a fixed 5 handles (Indices) / 10 pips (Forex).

### **Summary Checklist for a Valid Trade**
1.  Is it between **3-4 AM**, **10-11 AM**, or **2-3 PM** (NY Time)?
2.  Is there an obvious **Draw on Liquidity** (next likely target)?
3.  Did price form a **Fair Value Gap** after a liquidity sweep or structure shift?
4.  Does the setup offer at least **10 points** (Indices) or **15 pips** (Forex) of range?
